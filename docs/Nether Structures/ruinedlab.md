**Description:**
The Ruined lab is a circle-shaped structure with a glass dome roof inhabited by buffed Wither skeletons, also called Withered scientists. Those Withered scientists seem to be holding some Piglins hostage to do experiments on them and try to develop new weapons against the Piglins. At the center of the structure, we can find the remains of what might be a Wither cage mixed and or a Basalt generator. **Spawn Conditions:**
