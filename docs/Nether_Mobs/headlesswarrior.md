## Description
The Headless warriors are Wither skeletons found in the [Withered Forest](https://officiallysp.net/pokeywiki/Nether_Biomes/witheredforest.html) battlefields. Injured, they do not drop Wither skeleton heads or run when aggroed, but still do the same damages as before. Despite that and the fact that they will still attack players or Piglins near them, they can be easy targets. 

## Location
Headless warriors have a 50/76 chance to spawn in the [Withered Forest](https://officiallysp.net/pokeywiki/Nether_Biomes/witheredforest.html). 

## Loot
