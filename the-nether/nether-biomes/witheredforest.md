## Description:

The Withered forest is a dark biome, battlefield of a war between Piglins and Wither skeletons. Some tired Headless warriors can be found here alongside the Restless spirits of what is theorized to be fallen Piglins. Even after the dust settled, Withered scientists still conduct research in some Ruined lab hidden around this desolated land.
